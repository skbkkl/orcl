# Troubleshooting Windows Instances via Oracle OCI VM Console Connection with SAC
Console connections allow administrators to directly diagnose and fix issues with VMs that aren't working as expected. This is particularly helpful when an imported or custom image fails to boot, or when a previously working VM stops responding.
Using console connections, administrators can access the VM's serial output to make necessary repairs or changes, resolving issues quickly without needing physical access to the machine.
